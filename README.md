# "Test Driven Development With Python" Book

This repository will include all the code present in the above mentioned book, at the pace that I will have the execises completed.

It will hopefully have more in-depth comments than the ones present in the original repo, as suited to me for my current and future understanding.

## Tips

While following the book, make sure you have the Python Virtual Environment activated (see [prerequisites](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/pre-requisite-installations.html) for instructions).
The activation command is (for Mac/Linux):
```bash
python3.6 -m venv virtualenv
source virtualenv/bin/activate
```
